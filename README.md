# Flood Probability Prediction

This project predicts flood probability using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models. The main logic and workflow are contained in the Jupyter notebook `flood-probability-prediction.ipynb`.

> **Note:** Both the notebook (`flood-probability-prediction.ipynb`) and the `requirements.txt` file are available in the files section of this repository.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.)
- Ensemble methods (Voting, Stacking)
- Deep learning models (Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization, Conv1D)
- Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna
- Model evaluation and blending

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 5](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5) competition.
2. Place the dataset files in the appropriate directory as referenced in the notebook.
3. Open and run the `flood-probability-prediction.ipynb` notebook to reproduce the results, train models, and generate predictions.
